Ques 2 -  Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative positioning.


Answer:- 


Relative Position:
* An element with position: relative; is adjusted relative to its normal position.
* It doesn’t affect other content around it.
* Use the top, right, bottom, and left properties to shift it.


Absolute Positioning:
* An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (or the document body if none).
* It’s removed from the normal flow and can overlap other elements.
