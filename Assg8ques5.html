Question-- Explain the z-index, with a code example.??

Solution....
The z-index property in CSS is used to control the stacking order of positioned elements,
 primarily those with a position value of absolute, relative, fixed, or sticky.
 It determines the order in which elements are stacked on top of each other along the z-axis,
 creating a 3D-like effect even though web pages are inherently 2D.-->

 <div class = "container">
    <div class = "box box_1">z-index 1</div>
    <div class = "box box_2">z-index 2</div>
    <div class = "box box_3">z-index 3</div>
 </div>
